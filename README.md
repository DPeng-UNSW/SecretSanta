# SecretSanta
Simple SecretSanta draw program. Written in C for my friends and I for 2020 Christmas. Executed using the command line in Linux OS ./SecretSanta [seed] [name_1] ... [name_n]
Will generate text files for each name listed in the command line and output another person's name in that person's file. 
Each person needs to be sent their file and they will be gifting the person mentioned in their file.
